Note that there is an additional npm script to rebuild the package for electron, which is called from the install script:

```json
"electron-rebuild": "electron-rebuild -w opencv4nodejs"
```

## plain-js

This example shows how to use opencv4nodejs with electron and plain HTML + Javascript without any bundler.

### Running this example (plain-js)

#### Set up opencv4nodejs, electron and rebuild the module for electron

``` bash
npm install
```

#### Run

``` bash
npm start
```

## webpack-reactjs

This example shows how to use opencv4nodejs with webpack and react, requires node-loader to load the native addon.

``` bash
npm i node-loader
```

### On windows

If you are using the autobuild on windows, you have to append the path to the binaries
to the path env of main process manually as follows (in main.js):

```javascript
if (process.platform === 'win32' && !process.env.OPENCV4NODEJS_DISABLE_AUTOBUILD) {
  process.env.path += ';' + require('../renderer/node_modules/opencv-build').opencvBinDir
}
```

### Running this example (webpack-reactjs)

In the root directory:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

In another terminal cd into ./renderer and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Known issues

If you are receiving the following error on windows during electron-rebuild:

```bash
AttributeError: 'MSVSProject' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
```

Delete fsevents from your node_modules folder and rerun:

```bash
npm run electron-rebuild
```
